CODSOFT Internship
==================

This repository contains code of projects I've worked on during my internship at `CODSOFT`. As an intern, I've had the opportunity to learn, grow, and create exciting projects under the mentorship of the CodSoft team.

Task 1: [To-do List](Task1_ToDoList.py)</br>
Task 2: [Calculator](Task2_Calculator.py)</br>
Task 3: [Password Generator](Task3_PasswordGenerator.py)</br>

# Task 1: To-do List
This is a simple To-do List application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. The program allows users to add, delete, and update tasks in a user-friendly graphical interface</br>

### Features
- `Add Task`: Users can add tasks to the list.</br>
- `Delete Task`: Users can select a task from the list and delete it.</br>
- `Update Task`: Users can modify an existing task in the list.</br>

# Task 2: GUI Based Calculator
This is a GUI Based calculator application built using Python and the Tkinter library. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations, including `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, and `division`.

### Features
- <b>Numbers `0-9`:</b> Users can input required numbers for calculation by simply clicking on the numbers provided on calculator screen.</br>
- <b>Operators:</b> Choose required operators by clicking on skyblue coloured tabs.(`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`)</br>
- <b>Calculate `=`:</b> By clicking on 'equal to'`=` symbol answer will be displayed on screen.</br>
- <b>Clear Screen `C`:</b> By using button `C` user can clear the screen.</br>


# Task 3: Password Generator
This is a simple Python application that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria. It provides options for `password length` and character types (`uppercase`, `lowercase`, `digits`, and `special characters`) to customise the generated password.

### Features
- `Password Length`: Users can specify the desired length for the generated password.</br>
- `Character Sets`: Users can include or exclude character sets to tailor the password to their specific needs.</br>
                - Uppercase letters (A-Z)</br>
                - Lowercase letters (a-z)</br>
                - Digits (0-9)</br>
                - Special Characters (e.g.: !@#$%^&8<.>,{}[]\+-*/)</br>
- `Generate Password`: Clicking the "Generate Password" button will create a password based on the selected options.</br>
- `Clear`: The "Clear" button allows users to reset the input fields and start fresh.</br>
- `Error Handling`: The application also provides error handling to ensure that at least one character set is selected before generating a password.</br>
